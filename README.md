# TypeScript Expressly Example Application

[![Deploy to Fastly](https://deploy.edgecompute.app/button)](https://deploy.edgecompute.app/deploy)

Expressly is a lightweight and minimalist routing layer for JavaScript apps running on Fastly's Compute@Edge. Get to know the Fastly Compute@Edge environment with this Typescript Expressly starter that demonstrates routing and middleware. To learn more about Expressly, check out our [blog post](https://www.fastly.com/blog/write-less-do-more-at-the-edge-introducing-expressly) and visit our [documentation](https://expressly.edgecompute.app/).

**For more details about other starter kits for Compute@Edge, see the [Fastly developer hub](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/starters)**

## Understanding the code

This starter is intentionally lightweight, and only requires the [`@fastly/js-compute`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastly/js-compute) and [`@fastly/expressly`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastly/expressly) npm packages. 

The starter doesn't require the use of any backends. Once deployed, you will have a Fastly service running on Compute@Edge that can generate synthetic responses at the edge.
